Pothos (Epipremnum aureum): The Ultimate Guide to Care and Growing
Pothos, scientifically known as Epipremnum aureum, is one of the most popular and versatile houseplants. Often referred to as "Devil’s Ivy" or "Golden Pothos," it is well-loved for its lush, trailing vines, heart-shaped leaves, and low-maintenance care requirements. Native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands, Pothos is often used in homes, offices, and commercial spaces due to its ability to thrive in a variety of conditions. This detailed article will explore how Pothos looks, the different varieties available, and how to take care of it to ensure it remains a beautiful addition to any space.

Appearance of Pothos
Pothos is a striking vine plant known for its vibrant green foliage, with some varieties offering colorful variegation. Here’s an in-depth look at the plant’s appearance:

1. Leaves
Shape and Size: The leaves of Pothos are large, heart-shaped, and glossy. They typically grow between 3 to 6 inches long and 2 to 3 inches wide. The leaves have a waxy texture that gives them a shiny, polished appearance, making them a favorite in interior design.
Color: The leaves of the traditional Pothos plant are a vibrant green, but some varieties feature gold, yellow, or white variegation, adding to their aesthetic appeal.
Growth Habit: Pothos is a trailing or climbing plant, and its vines can grow several feet long. The vines are flexible, allowing the plant to be trained to grow in various directions, including hanging down from baskets, draping over shelves, or climbing trellises.
2. Vines
Length and Texture: Pothos vines can grow anywhere from 6 feet to 10 feet long indoors, depending on growing conditions. The vines are thick and sturdy, with small aerial roots that help the plant cling to surfaces when climbing.
Climbing Ability: Although it can grow as a trailing plant, Pothos is also capable of climbing if provided with the support, such as a moss pole or trellis. As the plant matures, the stems may become woody, and it may produce small, inconspicuous flowers, though this is uncommon in indoor settings.
Varieties of Pothos
Pothos comes in several popular varieties, each with unique leaf colors and patterns. Here are the most common types:

1. Golden Pothos (Epipremnum aureum)
Description: This is the most commonly known and widely grown variety. It has bright green leaves with yellow or gold marbling, creating a beautiful contrast. The golden hues in the leaves become more pronounced in brighter light conditions.
Ideal for: Beginners and casual plant owners who are looking for an easy-to-care-for plant with attractive foliage.
2. Marble Queen Pothos (Epipremnum aureum ‘Marble Queen’)
Description: Known for its striking white and green variegated leaves, the Marble Queen variety is highly ornamental. The white variegation often has a soft, marble-like appearance, and each leaf is unique.
Ideal for: Bright, indirect light conditions to maintain its variegation, although it can tolerate lower light levels.
3. Jade Pothos (Epipremnum aureum ‘Jade’)
Description: This variety has solid, deep green leaves, without the marbling or variegation seen in other varieties. The leaves are typically more consistent in color and have a more uniform appearance.
Ideal for: People who prefer a non-variegated look with a classic green aesthetic.
4. Neon Pothos (Epipremnum aureum ‘Neon’)
Description: The Neon Pothos is known for its vibrant, almost fluorescent yellow-green leaves. The striking neon color makes this variety stand out in any room, and it adds a splash of brightness to darker areas.
Ideal for: Low to moderate light conditions, though the vibrant color is most pronounced in brighter settings.
5. Pearls and Jade Pothos (Epipremnum aureum ‘Pearls and Jade’)
Description: This variety has a mix of white, cream, and light green marbling. The contrast between the dark green and lighter shades creates a beautiful, eye-catching appearance.
Ideal for: Bright, indirect light to maintain the contrasting colors of the leaves.
6. Manjula Pothos (Epipremnum aureum ‘Manjula’)
Description: The Manjula variety has large, heart-shaped leaves with creamy white or pale yellow variegation mixed with green. The variegation on this variety is more irregular and striking than that of Marble Queen.
Ideal for: Bright, indirect light to preserve the variegation.
How to Care for Pothos
Pothos is known for being one of the easiest houseplants to care for, making it perfect for beginners or those looking for a low-maintenance option. However, like all plants, it does require some attention to ensure it thrives. Below are the key care guidelines for keeping your Pothos plant healthy and vibrant.

1. Light Requirements
Ideal Light: Pothos thrives in bright, indirect light. It will tolerate low light conditions, but its growth may slow down, and the variegation may fade or become less vibrant. In lower light, the plant may develop longer, leggy vines as it searches for light.
Avoid Direct Sunlight: While Pothos can tolerate some sunlight, direct exposure can scorch its leaves. It’s best to keep the plant in a spot where it receives filtered light, such as near a north or east-facing window.
2. Watering Needs
Watering Schedule: Pothos prefers to dry out between waterings, so it’s essential to allow the top 1 to 2 inches of soil to dry before watering again. Overwatering can lead to root rot, so it's better to underwater than overwater. A good rule of thumb is to water the plant once every 1 to 2 weeks, depending on the temperature and humidity levels in your home.
Signs of Overwatering: Yellowing leaves or wilting are often signs of overwatering. If this occurs, allow the soil to dry out and ensure the plant is in a pot with good drainage.
Water Quality: Pothos is not particularly fussy about water quality, but it does best with room-temperature water. Letting tap water sit for 24 hours before using it can help reduce chlorine levels.
3. Soil and Potting
Well-Draining Soil: Pothos does best in well-draining potting mix. A general-purpose houseplant soil works well, or you can mix in perlite or sand to improve drainage.
Repotting: Pothos can be repotted every 1 to 2 years, or when it outgrows its pot. When repotting, choose a pot that’s 1-2 inches larger in diameter than the current one. Pothos is fairly tolerant of being root-bound, so it won’t need to be repotted too often.
4. Humidity and Temperature
Humidity: Pothos is adaptable to a range of humidity levels but thrives in moderate humidity. It can tolerate dry indoor air, though it will appreciate occasional misting if the air in your home is particularly dry, such as during winter months.
Temperature: Pothos prefers warm temperatures between 60°F and 85°F (16°C to 29°C). It is sensitive to cold temperatures and should not be exposed to drafts or temperatures below 50°F (10°C).
5. Fertilizing
Fertilizing Schedule: During the growing season (spring and summer), Pothos benefits from monthly feeding with a balanced, water-soluble fertilizer. Reduce feeding during the fall and winter when the plant is not actively growing.
Fertilizer Type: You can use a balanced fertilizer (NPK 20-20-20) diluted to half strength. Avoid over-fertilizing, as this can lead to leggy growth or burnt leaf tips.
6. Pruning and Maintenance
Pruning: Regular pruning encourages bushier growth and helps maintain a compact shape. Cut back long, leggy vines to keep the plant tidy and to promote the growth of new leaves.
Cleaning: Wipe the leaves occasionally with a damp cloth to remove dust, which will help the plant to photosynthesize more efficiently.
Common Problems and Solutions
1. Yellowing Leaves
Cause: Overwatering or too much direct sunlight can cause leaves to yellow.
Solution: Ensure proper watering practices and move the plant to a location with indirect light.
2. Leggy Growth
Cause: Low light conditions or insufficient pruning can lead to long, spindly vines.
Solution: Increase light exposure and prune back long vines to encourage more compact growth.
3. Brown Leaf Tips
Cause: Brown tips are often caused by low humidity or underwatering.
Solution: Increase humidity and water the plant regularly when the top inch of soil is dry.
Conclusion
Pothos is a hardy, beautiful, and low-maintenance plant that makes an excellent addition to any home or office. Whether you’re a seasoned plant enthusiast or a beginner, Pothos is an easy choice for adding greenery to your space. With a little attention to its basic care needs—such as proper watering, lighting, and occasional pruning—you can enjoy its vibrant, trailing vines and beautiful foliage for years to come.
