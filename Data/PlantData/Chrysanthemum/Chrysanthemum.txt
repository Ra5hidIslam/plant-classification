How to Take Care of Chrysanthemums
Growing and caring for chrysanthemums can be a rewarding experience. These plants are relatively low-maintenance if provided with the right conditions.

1. Light Requirements
Full Sun: Chrysanthemums thrive in full sunlight, requiring at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily.
Indoor Placement: When grown indoors, place them near a bright window to ensure sufficient light.
2. Soil
Well-Draining: Chrysanthemums prefer well-drained soil to prevent root rot.
Soil pH: A slightly acidic to neutral pH (6.0–7.0) is ideal.
Enrichment: Add organic matter such as compost or peat moss to enrich the soil.
3. Watering
Regular Watering: Water consistently to keep the soil evenly moist, especially during dry spells.
Avoid Overwatering: Ensure proper drainage to avoid waterlogging, which can harm the roots.
4. Fertilizing
Balanced Fertilizer: Apply a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring when new growth begins.
Frequency: Feed every 3–4 weeks during the growing season for vigorous blooms.
Avoid Overfertilization: Too much fertilizer can lead to leggy growth with fewer flowers.
5. Temperature and Humidity
Optimal Temperature: Chrysanthemums prefer moderate temperatures of 60°F–70°F (15°C–21°C) during the growing season.
Frost Protection: These plants are not frost-tolerant, so they should be brought indoors or covered in colder climates.
Humidity: While they tolerate various humidity levels, avoid excessive moisture to prevent fungal diseases.
6. Pruning and Pinching
Pinching: Pinch back the growing tips in early summer to encourage bushier growth and more flowers. Stop pinching by mid-July to allow buds to form.
Deadheading: Remove spent blooms to prolong the flowering period and maintain plant health.
Seasonal Pruning: Cut back the stems to a few inches above the ground after the flowering season.
7. Propagation
Division: Divide chrysanthemum clumps every 2–3 years in spring to rejuvenate the plant and produce new plants.
Cuttings: Take softwood cuttings in late spring or early summer for propagation.
8. Pests and Diseases
Common Pests: Aphids, spider mites, and thrips may attack chrysanthemums. Use insecticidal soap or neem oil to control infestations.
Diseases: Watch for fungal issues like powdery mildew or root rot, especially in humid conditions. Improve air circulation and avoid overhead watering to prevent these problems.
