How to Take Care of a Jade Plant
The Jade Plant is known for its low-maintenance nature, but providing the right conditions will ensure it thrives and flourishes.

1. Light Requirements

Jade Plants love bright, indirect sunlight and can tolerate some direct light.
Place them near a south or west-facing window for optimal growth.
Signs of Improper Light
Too Little Light: Stems become leggy, and leaves lose their vibrant color.
Too Much Light: Leaves may develop sunburn spots.
2. Watering
General Rule
Allow the soil to dry out completely between waterings.
Overwatering is the most common cause of problems like root rot.
Seasonal Adjustments
Water more frequently during the growing season (spring and summer).
Reduce watering significantly during fall and winter when the plant enters dormancy.
3. Humidity and Temperature
Jade Plants prefer low humidity, mimicking their native arid environment.
Keep them in temperatures between 60°F to 75°F (15°C to 24°C).

Regularly prune the Jade Plant to maintain its shape and size.
Remove dead or yellowing leaves to promote healthy growth.
7. Repotting
Repot the plant every 2–3 years or when it outgrows its pot.
Use a slightly larger container with good drainage.
8. Propagation
By Leaf or Stem Cuttings
Cut a healthy leaf or stem.
Allow the cutting to dry for 1–2 days to form a callus.
Plant it in well-draining soil and water sparingly until roots develop.
