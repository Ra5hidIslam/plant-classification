How to Take Care of African Violets
African violets are relatively easy to care for, provided their specific needs are met. Below is a comprehensive guide to ensure your plant thrives.

1. Light Requirements
Ideal Conditions
Place your African violet in bright, indirect light.
East-facing windows are ideal, as they provide gentle morning sunlight.
Artificial Light
If natural light is insufficient, use fluorescent or LED grow lights for 10–12 hours a day.
Signs of Improper Lighting
Too Little Light: Few or no blooms and leggy growth.
Too Much Light: Scorched leaves or faded colors.
2. Watering
Consistency
Keep the soil evenly moist but avoid overwatering, which can lead to root rot.
Use lukewarm water, as cold water can damage the leaves.
Watering Methods
Bottom Watering: Place the pot in a tray of water and allow the soil to absorb moisture from the bottom.
Avoid Wetting Leaves: Water on the leaves can cause spotting or fungal issues.
3. Humidity
African violets prefer a humidity level of 50–60%.
To increase humidity:
Place the pot on a tray filled with water and pebbles.
Use a room humidifier.
4. Temperature
Keep African violets in temperatures between 65°F and 75°F (18°C–24°C).
Avoid exposing the plant to drafts or sudden temperature changes.
5. Soil
Use a well-draining, lightweight soil mix specifically designed for African violets.
A mix containing peat moss, perlite, and vermiculite works well.
6. Fertilizing
Feed African violets with a balanced fertilizer, such as one formulated for blooming plants, every 2-4 weeks during the growing season.
Avoid over-fertilizing, which can lead to salt buildup and damage the roots.
7. Repotting
Repot African violets every 6–12 months to refresh the soil and encourage healthy growth.
Use a pot that is 1/3 the size of the plant’s diameter.
8. Pruning and Maintenance
Remove dead or yellowing leaves and spent flowers regularly to promote healthy growth.
Gently clean the leaves with a soft brush to remove dust.
9. Propagation
By Leaf Cuttings
Cut a healthy leaf with a 1-2 inch stem.
Insert the stem into moist soil or water.
Keep in a warm, humid environment until new roots and plantlets form.
10. Common Problems and Solutions
Yellow Leaves
Cause: Overwatering or insufficient light.
Solution: Adjust watering schedule and ensure proper light.
